# Accumulative SGD-Influence Estimator  
This project builds upon the [SGD-Influence](https://github.com/sato9hara/sgd-influence).

## Influence Estimation Task  
Navigate to `experiment/Sec71/shell`, then run:  
```bash
bash exp.sh
```  
The results will be stored in:  
```bash
./experiment/Sec71/shell/...
```  
You can experiment with different parameter settings, datasets, and model architectures to reproduce the results.

The visualization clearly highlights the differences between ACC-SGD-IE and the original SGD-IE.  

## Data Cleansing Task
Just use the original code provided in [SGD-Influence](https://github.com/sato9hara/sgd-influence).
