# Enhanced-SGD-Influence-Estimator  

## Overview  
This project builds upon the [SGD-Influence](https://github.com/sato9hara/sgd-influence) repository, extending its capabilities to improve multi-epoch influence estimation. Our enhancements aim to provide better accuracy in SGD-Influence Estimation task and  Dataset Cleansing tasks.  

## Usage  
Navigate to `experiment/Sec71/shell`, then run:  
```bash
bash error_ana.sh
```  
The results will be stored in:  
```bash
./experiment/Sec71/shell/200_corrupted/mnist_dnn_1_20_0.1_noinit
```  
You can experiment with different parameter settings, datasets, and model architectures to reproduce the results. The provided configuration serves as a reference.  

The visualization clearly highlights the differences between our Enhanced SGD-Influence Estimator and the original SGD-Influence Estimator.  

## Additional Information  
The code for the data cleansing task will be released based on the review outcome.
